#we created an app.js which is the main javascript file that has the code to start the web server and take a request at "/"
#let's start the web server by running "npm start"
#Let's open a web browser to test our app

#if you want to test it in a terminal, you can do...
#we are done with the application

#IMPORTANT: You need to create your own git account and you may need to login to your github account from your terminal before you are able to run your commands. I am sure you know that :-)
